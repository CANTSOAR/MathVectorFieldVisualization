# MathVectorFieldVisualization
an intriguing concept of using vector fields to model changing systems over time

uses given data to make and sumplify a vector field, such that it can be used for predictions in the future
the main issue was generalizing the field to points that never actually occurred in the "training" dataset
this was solved by approximating equations and just guessing until i was satisfied
